<h1>About the Void Of Darkness</h1>
<p>Let us start from the beginning, Void of darkness started as your traditional gamer space for people to come together and play games as most do. To go into more detail it was originally oriented from a game released in November 2020 by Harmonix this game was known as Fuser. Fuser was a rhythm/music DJ game in which its users solo or collaboratively in co-op could place stems from their everyday songs onto the DJ decks an example to easily understand is Killing in the name of drums, Satisfaction bass, Ghosts and stuff lead, with Never going to give you up lyrics and plays them at the same time, You got some really amazing and very surprising results. 
</p>
<p>
    This is where we all met one another and formed a discord group in order for us to find each other easily again and keep in contact. Throughout this journey people really started falling in love with music and went to DJ themselves and/or straight to music production. A lot of us started out as DJs and we wanted more so we all moved into music production we haven't stopped even after the recent news that Fuser servers are now coming to a close, it's a time we will never forget and has probably made us all that much closer to not just each other but towards all our music as well. 
</p>
<p>
    In December 2022 the Void of Darkness Productions LLC was born a big group of music-loving enthusiasts and close friends playing games daily together and who collaborate and make music together as a team like back in the Fuser days.
